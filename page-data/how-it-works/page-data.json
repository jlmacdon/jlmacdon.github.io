Today, doctors spend a lot of time explaining procedures. They often have to repeat themselves, especially since patients are not always in the proper state of mind to process all the information and make a decision. Instead, medApprise gives patients an opportunity to understand their situation on their own time, freeing up doctorsâ€™ time to work with other patients. Keep reading to find out how it works!
