  title: Helping Doctors, Patients, and Hospitals
  description: >-
    medApprise aims to change how doctors inform patients about their surgeries, as well as any steps that need to be taken before or after their operation to ensure optimal results. Today, doctors spend a lot of time explaining procedures. They often have to repeat themselves, especially since patients are not always in the proper state of mind to process all the information and make a decision. Instead, medApprise gives patients an opportunity to understand their situation on their own time, freeing up doctorsâ€™ time to work with other patients. Keep reading to find out how it works!
