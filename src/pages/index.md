  title: medApprise Reinvents Informing Patients Around Shared Decision Making (SDM)
  description: >-
    Our product reinvents patient counseling and the informed consent process. We remove the 80-90% of counseling that is pure repetition and deliver the information, created by the providers themselves, to the patients asynchronously in the form of videos. The platform serves as a mechanism to create, store, share, and vet counseling content to fit exactly to the provider's needs. It supplies a patient-facing portal for delivery and documentation, and effectively lets the doctor be in two places at once and allows the patient to spend as much time as they need with the material.

        Providers create and select the exact materials that the want their patients to have for background information and education. Patients receive unlimited access to view those materials on their own time in any comfortable setting and along with family. The materials are prerecorded once and used many times, saving tremendous time and resources.

        Patients are much better prepared to discussing issues at subsequent visits and participating in shared decision making and informed consent. This greatly improves comprehension, patient expectations, patient satisfaction, and reduces medical legal risk associated with unanticipated outcomes.

        Completed video encounters are automatically and irrefutably documented and notarized to a blockchain ledger. This saves the provider a tremendous amount of time and allows them to focus hand generated documentation on patient specific, high value issues. This greatly reduces medical legal risk.

        Automated playback of content by the patients allow the provider to be engaged in other activities during the viewing time. This greatly enhances productivity and enables providers to provide better care for more patients.

        MedApprise has been a great enhancement to my clinical workflow. It is intuitive to use and requires minimal training of staff. My patients like the ability to listen to educational videos on their time, and they feel like our communication has been clearer. Iâ€™ve enjoyed the increased productivity that it allows in my patient encounters, effectively letting me be in two places at the same time! I wish I had found this program years ago.
