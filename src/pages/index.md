  title: medApprise Reinvents Informing Patients Around Shared Decision Making (SDM)
  description: >-
    Our product reinvents patient counseling and the informed consent process. We remove the 80-90% of counseling that is pure repetition and deliver the information, created by the providers themselves, to the patients asynchronously in the form of videos. The platform serves as a mechanism to create, store, share, and vet counseling content to fit exactly to the provider's needs. It supplies a patient-facing portal for delivery and documentation, and effectively lets the doctor be in two places at once and allows the patient to spend as much time as they need with the material.

        Providers create and select the exact materials that the want their patients to have for background information and education. Patients receive unlimited access to view those materials on their own time in any comfortable setting and along with family. The materials are prerecorded once and used many times, saving tremendous time and resources.

        Patients are much better prepared to discussing issues at subsequent visits and participating in shared decision making and informed consent. This greatly improves comprehension, patient expectations, patient satisfaction, and reduces medical legal risk associated with unanticipated outcomes.

        Completed video encounters are automatically and irrefutably documented and notarized to a blockchain ledger. This saves the provider a tremendous amount of time and allows them to focus hand generated documentation on patient specific, high value issues. This greatly reduces medical legal risk.

        Automated playback of content by the patients allow the provider to be engaged in other activities during the viewing time. This greatly enhances productivity and enables providers to provide better care for more patients.

        Bilbo used often to say there was only one Road; that it was like a great river: its springs were at every doorstep, and every path was its tributary.

        But in the end, it's only a passing thing, this shadow. Even darkness must pass. A new day will come. And when the sun shines it will shine out the clearer.
