  title: medApprise Reinvents Informing Patients Around Shared Decision Making (SDM)
  description: >-
    Our product reinvents patient counseling and the informed consent process. We remove the 80-90% of counseling that is pure repetition and deliver the information, created by the providers themselves, to the patients asynchronously in the form of videos. The platform serves as a mechanism to create, store, share, and vet counseling content to fit exactly to the provider's needs. It supplies a patient-facing portal for delivery and documentation, and effectively lets the doctor be in two places at once and allows the patient to spend as much time as they need with the material.

        But in the end, it's only a passing thing, this shadow. Even darkness must pass. A new day will come. And when the sun shines it will shine out the clearer.
